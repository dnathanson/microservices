This area is for prototyping and playing with technologies for building the new AppDirect microservices architecture.

Currently, there are modules for:

* microservices-netflix - Microservice Architecture using Spring Cloud + Netflix
* microservices-consul - Microservice Architecture using Spring Cloud + Hashicorp's Consul + Netflix (Hystrix, Ribbon, Feign)
